# Diwali-Sales-Analysis
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Diwali sales data using Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn),
involving 1,000+ sales records.
Cleaned and preprocessed data by dropping irrelevant columns and handling missing values, reducing null entries by 10%.
Visualized sales trends across gender, age groups, states, and marital status; identified that males contributed 60% of the
sales revenue, with individuals aged 26-35 being the highest spenders.
Analyzed sales across product categories and states; found that 40% of sales came from the top 5 states.
Quantified revenue contributions by different customer occupations and demographics, helping understand key sales
drivers for targeted marketing strategies
